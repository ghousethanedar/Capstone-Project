# Data science Capstone-Project
Problem statement:

People often spend a lot of time browsing through online shopping websites, but the coversion rate into purchases is low. Determine the likelihood of purchase based on the given features in the datsaset. The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 online sessions. The purpose of this project is to identify user behaviour patterns to effectively understand features that influence the sales.

Data Description:

The dataset cointains the following features:

Features	Description	DataType
Administrative	Number of pages visited by the user for user account management related activities	Discrete values from 0 to 27 
Administrative_Duration	Time spent on Admin pages by the user	Continuous value (time in seconds)
Informational	Number of pages visited by the user about the website	Discrete values from 0 to 24
Informational_Duration	Time spent on Informational pages by the user	Continuous value (time in seconds)
ProductRelated	Number of product related pages visited by the user 	Discrete values from 0 to 705
ProductRelated_Duration	Time spent on Product related pages by the user	Continuous value (time in seconds)
BounceRates	Average bounce rate of the pages visited by the user	Continuous value 
ExitRates	Average exit rate of the pages visited by the user	Continuous value 
PageValues	Average page value of the pages visited by the user	Continuous value 
SpecialDay	Closeness of the visiting day to a special event like Motherâ€™s Day or festivals like Christmas	Discrete values (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0)
Month	Month of the visit from Jan to Dec	Categorical
OperatingSystems	OperatingSystems of the visitor	Discrete values from 0 to 7
Browser	Browser of the visitor	Discrete values from 0 to 12
Region	Geographic region from which the session has been started by the visitor	Discrete values from 0 to 8
TrafficType	Traffic source through which user has entered the website	Discrete values from 0 to 19
VisitorType	Visitor type as New visitor, Returning user or Others	Categorical
Weekend	If the user visited on a weekend or not	Boolean
Revenue	If the user visit resulted with a transaction	Boolean




Instructions:

1.	Perform the required data pre-processing to treat for missing values and outliers.
2.	Perform exploratory data analysis to visualise the spread of each of the X variables and the relationship between the various X variables and the Y variable
3.	Divide the given data into train and test sets
4.	Predict how likely it is for a customer to make a purchase by building classification models
5.	Interpret how each of the X variables influence the conversion propensity
6.	Evaluate the model performance measures and choose the most optimum model
7.	Enlist your key findings based on the most optimum model and the respective feature importance
